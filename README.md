## Overview
VPartnerLib is a SDK that allows Partners to easily integrate Vodafone World into their apps.
The SDK will allow partners to centralize and do everything related with their devices under one app. This means:

- Onboard users into the Vodafone CIoT Platform, being the users Vodafone or Non-Vodafone.
- Manage their device subscriptions. This includes, adding, editing, removing and perform paying operations related to their devices and subscriptions. 

The SDK is built under Vodafone's design system, but allows for the Partners to use their own logos and colours for a seamless experience. 

### Requirements
- XCode 13+
- iOS 12.0+

### Supported Architectures
The following architectures are supported by VPartnerLib .xcframework
- arm64
- x86_64_simulator

## Setup
Start by taking a look at the example project provided in this Repo.

### Pods

We use pods, for a easy integration of the SDK you must guarantee the VPartnerLib pod are part of your `Podfile`:

```ruby
  source 'https://github.com/squadk-celfocus/public-partner-sdk-example-ios.git'

  pod 'VPartnerLib',  '3.0.0'
```

And run `pod install` or `pod install --repo-update` (If you are already using pods for VPartnerLib).

You are required to use Cocoapods 1.11.0 or newer.
Also, make sure you use `use_frameworks!` to avoid issues while building and running your project.

## Integration

### Keys
In order to run the SDK a `ClientID` and `GrantID` or `PartnerPassword` are necessary.
Each partner is entitled to one. Contact the SquaDK team in order to get these keys.

### GoogleService-info.plist
Since the SDK uses Firebase, a GoogleService-info.plist is required to run the `FirebaseApp.configure()` function. 
Therefore you'll need to [add Firebase to your project](#https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup?hl=pt).

### Required Permissions
In order to run the SDK the following permissions are required under your `.plist` file:
- NSCameraUsageDescription
- NSContactsUsageDescription
- NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription
